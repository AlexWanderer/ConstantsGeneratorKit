ConstantsGeneratorKit
=====================

This little script will generate static classes for layers, scenes, tags and resources. You will find the trigger to kick off the script in the "Edit/Generate Constants Classes". It will spit out the constants classes in the scripts/Autogenerated folder by default in the "k" namespace. This allows you can use autocomplete to easily access them without having to worry about future changes, random ints and strings all over your code.
